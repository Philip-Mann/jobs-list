<!-- Hello Irina Smirnova,  

This letter is to express my interest in the Front End Developer position at Proxet.  As youâ€™ll see, I have hands-on experience efficiently developing fully responsive web applications, front-end and back-end, using React/Redux, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Building state-of-the-art, easy to use, user-friendly websites and applications is truly a passion of mine and I am confident I would be an excellent addition to the development team. In addition to my knowledge base, I actively seek out new technologies and stay up to date on industry trends and advancements. This has allowed me to stay ahead of the curve and deliver exceptional code on every project I have worked on.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you about this opportunity. 

Best Regards,  

Philip J. Mann -->
